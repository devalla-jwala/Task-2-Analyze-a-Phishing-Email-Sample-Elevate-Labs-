# üõ° Phishing Email Sample Analysis 

This repository documents the analysis of a phishing email impersonating Binance. It highlights how threat actors use spoofing, misaligned headers, and social engineering to deceive recipients.

---

##  1. Sample Overview

A phishing email was analyzed that falsely claimed to be from Binance.  
- **Subject**: `[Bin–∞n—Å–µ] Immediate verification required for rodrigo-f-p@hotmail.com`  
- The subject line raised suspicion due to its **urgent tone** and **unusual formatting** of the sender name, suggesting a potential scam.

---

##  2. Sender Spoofing Detected

The email **pretends** to be from:  
`do-not-reply@ses.binance.com`

However:
- The **actual sending domain** was `ilonasavola.com`
- The **Return-Path** was `wpcloud@ilonasavola.com`

This clearly indicates that the email **did not originate from Binance**, and is an example of **sender spoofing**.

---

##  3. Header Discrepancies

After header analysis using MXToolbox, multiple technical issues were found:

-  **SPF** failed: The sending IP was not authorized to send on behalf of Binance‚Äôs domain.
-  **DKIM** missing: The message was not cryptographically signed.
-  **DMARC** failed: The domain could not be verified by recipient servers.

 These authentication failures confirm the email is **not legitimately from Binance**.

---

##  4. Suspicious Links or Attachments

The full body of the email was not provided. However:
- The **urgency** in the subject line
- The **impersonation of Binance**
- The **spoofed sender address**

...all strongly suggest that the message likely contained a **malicious link** (e.g., a fake login page designed to steal user credentials).

---

##  5. Urgent & Threatening Language

The subject line used the phrase:
> **"Immediate verification required"**

This is a common **social engineering technique**, pressuring the recipient to act quickly without thinking. It plays on fear and urgency to increase the chances of a successful phishing attempt.

---

##  6. Visual Spoofing Using Unicode

The word **‚ÄúBin–∞n—Å–µ‚Äù** in the subject is **not typed using standard English letters**:
- It uses **Cyrillic characters** that visually resemble Latin ones.

 This Unicode spoofing method:
- Helps attackers **bypass email filters**
- Tricks human readers by **mimicking familiar brand names**

---

##  7. Spelling and Grammar Issues

While obvious spelling or grammar issues weren't seen in the header alone, the **use of character substitution** (Unicode spoofing) is a known deception strategy in phishing:

- It avoids detection by traditional spam filters
- It mimics brand names in ways that are **difficult to visually distinguish**

---

##  8. Summary of Phishing Traits Identified

| Indicator                              | Status     |
|----------------------------------------|------------|
|  Spoofed sender address               | ‚úîÔ∏è Detected |
|  SPF/DKIM/DMARC authentication failed | ‚úîÔ∏è Detected |
|  Unrelated sending domain             | ‚úîÔ∏è Detected |
|  Urgent & pressuring language         | ‚úîÔ∏è Detected |
|  Unicode lookalike characters         | ‚úîÔ∏è Detected |
| Likely malicious links (body not shown) | Suspected   |

---

##  Conclusion

This email is a **confirmed phishing attempt** that uses both **technical deception** (spoofed headers, failed authentication, foreign sending domains) and **psychological manipulation** (urgency, visual brand impersonation) to trick recipients.

Users should:
- **Never click links** in such emails
- **Report** messages to their security teams or email providers
- **Verify** communication by going directly to official websites
